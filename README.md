linux-kirkwood-3.7
==================

Kernel 3.7 for Marvell Kirkwood devices

Based on Arch Linux ARM kernel 3.6.
See https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs/tree/master/core/linux-kirkwood

This builds as linux-kirkwood-3.7 and linux-headers-kirkwood-3.7.

Kernels > 3.1 require a newer bootloader than some Kirkwood devices originally came with.

This kernel builds for every kirkwood platform as Arch Linux ARM's. However,
I did only test it on a GoFlex Net, don't blame me if your device becomes unbootable or explodes etc. pp.
